### Project Description
Sudoku-Wake is a productivity-focused alarm clock app that requires users to solve a Sudoku puzzle to silence the alarm. It ensures the brain is fully stimulated and awake, preventing the habit of mindlessly hitting the snooze button

### The Problem statement
Many people struggle with 'sleep inertia' and the habit of hitting snooze repeatedly, which leads to oversleeping and a sluggish start to the day. Standard alarms are too easy to turn off while half-asleep, failing to actually wake the user's cognitive functions

### The Solution
We are integrating a cognitive challenge directly into the wake-up routine. By using a Sudoku interface, the app forces the user to engage in logical problem-solving. The alarm will only deactivate once a puzzle of a chosen difficulty is solved, ensuring the user is mentally alert by the time the noise stops
